## Algorithms

The idea is to implement the Thompson's construction algorithm to compile a regular expression (regex) into an equivalent nondeterministic finite automaton (NFA). This NFA will be used to match strings againts the regular expression. The program will also preprocess the string to allow for richer regex syntax ([1-9], \d etc). Finally the NFA is used to match the string.

If there is time I will implement a NFA to DFA transformation and compare it's performance to the NFA implementation using only a NFA. 

#### Thompson's contruction

The algorithm works recursively by splitting an expression into its constituent subexpressions, from which the NFA will be constructed using [a set of rules](https://perl.plover.com/Regex/article.html) (*How to Turn a Regex into a Penny Machine*).

The algorithm has following properties: 

1. Has a single initial state which can't be reached from any other state.
2. Has a single final state which is connected to all accepting states with a empty transition.
3. The number of states leaving any state is at most two.
4. Since an NFA of m states and at most e transitions from each state can match a string of length n in time O(emn), a Thompson NFA can do pattern matching in linear time, assuming a fixed-size alphabet.

#### Preprocessing

Preprocessing removes all the syntactical sugar from the regex. For example [1-5] is tranformed into (1|2|3|4|5). This allows for richer regexes making the program more powerful for the user while also making the internal workings of the program simpler. The preprocesser can also add useful metacharacters in the input string to make the work of the NFA constructor easier.

#### Matching strings

NFA is given the input string for matching. It handles the input by using these rules:

1. To start, enqueue the first state to active states queue Q.
2. Whenever the machine reads an input character c, dequeue all the states from Q one by one. If a dequeued state X has an outgoing arrow(s) labeled c add the state(s) at the end of the arrow(s) to Q. If there is a blank arrow leading from state X to Y, then whenever X is enqueued to Q, also enqueue Y to Q.
3. If there are still more characters in the input string return to 2 reading the next char c. 
4. If one of the dequeued states was the final state and the input string has been read then the input string is matched. Otherwise the string is not matched.

## Data structures

The states created during construction of a NFA are their own data structure. They contain all the needed information to simulate a NFA state: what states are connection to it and what kind of a state it is (start, finish, other). 

A queue is used to store the active states during the runtime of the program.  

If functionality to have multiple NFAs constructed at the same time is implemented then some sort of data structure will be created to store them. A basic list perhaps.

Other data structures might be added as needs arise.

## The problems and solutions

Contructing NFA's is useful for programs that try to match the same regex multiple times because it is faster than simulating the regex when applied on multiple different strings. UNIX grep is a good example of this. It would be really slow if you had to simulate the regex on input big sizes without a NFA.

I chose Thompson's construction as the algorithm to perform the transformation because it is the original and most well known one. You can also find lots of material on it online.  

The data structures used here seemed to make the most sense. A state as a structure seems like a good idea and using a queue to help with handling the active states during matching the input is logical.

## Using the program

The program takes a regex or a string as an input. The regexes are used to contruct NFA's and input strings are match against a regex (the last one construted or any if I have the time to implement this).

## Target time and space complexity

* The target time complexity for preprocessing the regex is O(n) with space complexity of O(n).
* The target time complexity for constructing a NFA is O(nÂ²) with space complexity of O(n).
* The target time complexity for matching the string is O(n) with space complexity of O(n).
